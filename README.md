# imadel


## how to run

1. activate debugger in chrome 

2. load the extension in chrome

3. open the page 'one link.mhtml'

4. run the server (imadel-api) that prints the request body data to the console

5. click on download csv that should trigger the extension to extract the data

## The issue we need to solve?

- the extension should extract the data from the page (already done) and save it to the server
- the extension should display a message on the page to indicate that the data has been extracted and sent to the server
